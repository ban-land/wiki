# Beacon Waypoints
[Beacons](beacons.md) on ban land serve the purpose of fast travel in addition to their normal abilities
Given two beacons in different locations, you can link one tp the other (or both together) and teleport between them.
They work across dimensions, and have no distance limit.

## Beacon Addresses
Beacon points are identified by addresses. Each waypoint has a single, unique adress used to identify it across all of ban land, in all dimensions.

Adresses are represented in the world by blocks built around the base of the beacon (bordering the [resource blocks]()).

The <span style="color: red;">red</span> blocks show what blocks are used in a beacon address. Any block can be used to create an address, and any number of blocks can be used as well (as long as you can fit them). Because they are unique. once an address is used it cannot be used again by any other beacons until the original is dismantled. The base of the beacon (made of [resource blocks]()) does not count as part of the address, and as such those blocks are ignored. A beacon address can contain air blocks (that is, no block in a space) but it _cannot_ be made entirely of air (no blocks). ![Digitally enhanced screen shot from "BananaPU"'s video.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0511226d-fa6c-49bd-b577-092d95d61e3a)


## Destinations
Each waypoint can have one destination address.

To set a destination, simply build the same pattern as the address of your intended destination on the next level upward (above the beacon base).

For instance, if we wanted to have our <span style="color: red;">red</span> addressed beacon teleport us to a <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> addressed beacon, we would construct the other address on top.

The most common setup is 2 beacons that have eachother set as destinations.

Simply give them each a unique address, and then set each destination on each as the other's address.

The destination can be built up to 10 blocks vertically from the base to allow for decorative builds.

## Activation
To activate a beacon as a waypoint, simply sneak/crouch on top of it. It will trigger a "click" sound to let you know it is now active as a waypoint.

If you are unable to activate a waypoint, it means the address used has already been created by another player and is currently on an active waypoint.

You can use this knowledge to teleport to other people's waypoints by constructing your own waypoint with that address as a destination.

A waypoint requires an address to be activated. You do not need an activated waypoint to teleport, but only activated waypoints can be teleported to.

Keep this in mind when building two-way beacon waypoints, as you want to build each beacon's address and activate them first before building their destinations.

If you wish to deactivate a waypoint, simply break the beacon or break a part of the beacon's address.

Similarly, if a beaconâ€™s address is broken or changed you must reactivate it by sneaking/crouching again.
